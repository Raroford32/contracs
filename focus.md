# Focus Card — Current Investigation State

last_updated: 2026-02-03T00:00:00Z

## Goal (Never Changes)

Discover an **E3-promoted**, economically feasible exploit in a mature, battle-tested protocol.

**Stop Conditions:**
1. E3 achieved with net_profit > $10,000 USD
2. External interrupt (emit resume_pack.md)

**Never Stop For:**
- "No bugs found"
- Coverage targets met
- Iterations completed

---

## Current Target

- **Protocol**: [Not yet selected]
- **Chain**: Ethereum Mainnet (chainid=1)
- **Fork Block**: [To be pinned]
- **TVL**: [Query via DeBank]

---

## Active Hypothesis

- **hypothesis_id**: [None]
- **category**: [Must be valid category, NOT banned]
- **status**: E0 (idea)
- **target_state**: [Description]

---

## Next Action

- **skill**: protocol-mapper
- **reason**: Need to build protocol context before analysis
- **expected_output**: intelligence/protocol_contexts/*.json

---

## Banned Pattern Check

Before proceeding, verify hypothesis does NOT match:
- [ ] FIRST_DEPOSITOR / EMPTY_VAULT
- [ ] UNINITIALIZED_PROXY
- [ ] SIMPLE_REENTRANCY
- [ ] BASIC_ACCESS_CONTROL
- [ ] TIMESTAMP_MANIPULATION
- [ ] SIMPLE_OVERFLOW
- [ ] DONATION_ATTACK
- [ ] SIMPLE_FRONTRUNNING
- [ ] ORACLE_MANIPULATION_WITHOUT_COST

---

## Recent Evidence

| Timestamp | Hypothesis | Experiment | Result | Convergence |
|-----------|------------|------------|--------|-------------|
| - | - | - | - | - |

---

## Rehydration Order (If Lost)

1. Read this file (focus.md)
2. Read resume_pack.md
3. Read hypothesis_ledger.md
4. Tail experiments.jsonl
5. Check graphs/*.json

---

## No-Orphan-Work Rule

If you cannot name:
- The next skill to invoke
- The expected artifact output
- How it advances toward E3

Then you are drifting. Stop and rehydrate.
