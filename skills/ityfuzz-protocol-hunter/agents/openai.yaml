  short_description: "Deep protocol fuzzing and exploit generation with ItyFuzz"
  default_prompt: "Use the 2026 sequence-driven vulnerability taxonomy to build a hypothesis matrix, then run ItyFuzz (onchain fork / offchain artifacts / Foundry harness) to discover cross-contract exploit sequences. Deliver the exact command, work_dir outputs, the minimal replay trace, and a Foundry PoC that asserts the broken invariant/value discontinuity."
